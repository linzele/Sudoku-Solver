## Instructions

### Prerequisites

-   Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
-   The Sudoku board Java class (`sudokuBoard.java`) should be available in the project directory.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

-   Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Running the Project

1.  Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt window.
3.  Navigate to the directory where the project files are located.
4.  Compile the `sudokuSolver.java` file by running the following command:
    
    
    `javac sudokuSolver.java`
    
5.  After successful compilation, run the program with the following command:
    
    
    `java sudokuSolver`

### Viewing the Solved Sudoku Board

-   After running the solver, the program will display the solved Sudoku board in the console.
-   Each number represents a filled cell, and a dot (`'.'`) represents an empty cell.
-   The solved Sudoku board will adhere to the rules of Sudoku (no repeating digits in rows, columns, or subgrids).

## Customization and Extension

-   You can extend this project by implementing additional functionalities such as:
    -   Reading Sudoku puzzles from external files.
    -   Providing user interfaces for inputting and visualizing Sudoku puzzles.
    -   Optimizing the solver algorithm for efficiency.
